##### Need to declare scope (can only be called once within atom)

<em><sub>multiple snippets must be put under the scope</sub></em>

```coffeescript
'.ruby.source':
```
```coffeescript
'.text.html.erb':
```
##### `$` followed by a number are the tabs stops which can be cycled between by pressing tab once a snippet has been triggered
